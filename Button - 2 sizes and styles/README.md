This button has 2 styles, a outline version and a primary version.
You can choose which one by passing the props:  buttonStyle='btn--outline' || 'buttonStyle ='btn--primary'.
Note: if you don't pass it, it will select by default the primary one.

You can also have 2 different sizes: ['btn--medium', 'btn--large']; 
Again, in order to use it, pass the props selecting which one: buttonSize: 'btn--large' || 'btn--medium'
Note: if you don't pass it, it will select by default the medium one.
